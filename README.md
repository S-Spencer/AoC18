# AoC18
 Attempt at the Advent of Code 2018 from day 14 on using Python. Previous days have already been completed.
 I am attempting this puzzle using GitHub in order to get in the habit of how GitHub works to some extent; creating a branch, commits, merges etc.
 The limitations of this exercise is that I am working solo on this project and so the collaborative nature of GitHub will be missed, but I wish to gain experience in basic functions of GitHub before working with others.
